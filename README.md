# BibleApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.3.

**[Live preview](https://bibleapp-fcc5b.web.app/)**:https://bibleapp-fcc5b.web.app/


I had to do some research on the Scripture for my work. I read in pdf format, but it was slow and difficult to navigate either on a PC or a mobile device. I wanted to move fast and make it mobile. However, the solution I found on Google Store did not satisfy me.


I decided to make on my own. The tasks are fast navigation and a nice UI. I chose it to be PWA.


I did the design in Figma. Then I took Angular and Ngrx to build the app. I had no data - the content of The Bible. So I made a script in Python to extract the content and transfer it to JSON.


This is a **beta version**.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
